# Phase 1 Project BOTW Item Search
This JavaScript single page application allows users to search for items in Nintendo's "Breath of the Wild" using an API. 

## Features
- Search for items by name.
- Display the item name, image, and description from the results.
- Display a list of the last five searched items.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Search Items
To search for an item, type the item's name into the search bar and click the "Submit" button. The item's name, image, and description will be displayed in the results section.

### View Previously Searched Items
The last five items searched will be displayed in the "Previously Searched Items" section. After 5 items, the application will remove the name and image from the right-most area of the screen.
